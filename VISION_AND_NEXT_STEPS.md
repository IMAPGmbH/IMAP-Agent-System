IMAP Agent Building System - Vision and Next Steps
üéØ Project Vision

The long-term vision for the IMAP Agent Building System is to create a highly autonomous and intelligent platform capable of handling a significant portion of the web development lifecycle with minimal human oversight for a defined range of project types.

Key characteristics of the envisioned system:

    Increased Autonomy: Agents should be able to make more complex decisions, self-correct minor issues, and require less explicit step-by-step guidance in their tasks.

    Broader Skillset: Expansion of toolsets and agent capabilities to cover more aspects of web development (e.g., database interaction, frontend framework specific code generation, basic deployment tasks, more sophisticated testing).

    Adaptive Planning: The Project Manager agent should be able to dynamically adjust plans based on feedback from other agents or unforeseen issues.

    Learning & Improvement (Long-term): Mechanisms for the system to learn from past projects or feedback to improve its planning and execution strategies.

    User-Friendly Interface: A simple interface for users to define project requirements, monitor progress, and retrieve final deliverables (beyond the current file-based system).

    Robust Error Handling & Self-Healing: Enhanced ability of agents to handle tool errors, API failures, or unexpected outputs gracefully and attempt recovery actions.

    Specialized LLM Utilization: Leveraging the best-suited LLMs for each agent role (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro for PM/Dev, Mistral for Testing, Codestral for Debugging) once API access is established.

üõ£Ô∏è Immediate Next Steps (Post-Initial Phase)

Based on the current successful implementation of core functionalities, the following are the immediate priorities for the next development phase:

    Enhance SecureCommandExecutorTool (Security & Robustness):

        Implement Robust Output Scrubbing: Critical for preventing leakage of sensitive information from command outputs.

        Integrate Docker Sandboxing: Execute commands within isolated Docker containers for maximum security.

    Finalize AdvancedFileOpsTool (Robustness):

        Implement ignore_patterns Logic: Prevent agents from accessing/modifying sensitive or irrelevant files/directories (e.g., .git, project-specific .env files, build artifacts) using a configurable ignore list.

    Implement PlaywrightBrowserTool - Advanced Features (Functionality):

        Add more browser actions:

            take_screenshot_tool(file_path: str, selector: Optional[str] = None)

            fill_form_field_tool(selector: str, value: str) (refine type_text_tool)

            select_dropdown_option_tool(selector: str, value: str)

            wait_for_element_tool(selector: str, state: str = 'visible', timeout: int = 10000)

        Improve multi-page/tab management if needed.

    Implement GeminiVisionAnalyzerTool (Functionality - PM):

        Allow the Project Manager to analyze design mockups or UI screenshots.

        Focus on extracting layout information, color palettes, and key UI components.

    Context Management & Long-Term Memory - Phase 1 (Scalability & Intelligence):

        TextSummarizationTool: Develop a dedicated tool for summarizing larger text chunks (e.g., long research articles, extensive code files) before storing them or passing them between agents.

        Basic ChromaDB Integration:

            Create a simple mechanism for agents (especially Researcher and PM) to embed and store key information (e.g., final research reports, planning decisions, code snippets with descriptions) in ChromaDB.

            Implement a basic tool for agents to perform semantic searches on this ChromaDB instance.

    "Full Repo Load" for Project Manager (Context):

        Implement the functionality within AdvancedFileOpsTool (or a new dedicated tool) that allows the PM to load the relevant textual content of the entire /application directory at the beginning of each planning step.

    Refine Debug Agent Workflow (Robustness):

        Extend the current error workflow to enable the Debug Agent to not only suggest a fix but also to instruct the Developer Agent to apply the fix.

        Implement a re-testing loop after a fix has been applied.

    Configuration for Specialized LLMs:

        Refactor agents.py and main.py to allow easy configuration of different LLMs (and their respective API keys, if needed) for different agent roles, preparing for the use of Gemini 2.5 Pro, Mistral, etc.

These steps will significantly enhance the capabilities, robustness, and intelligence of the IMAP Agent Building System, moving it closer to its long-term vision.
